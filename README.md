# Capycoin:
##  What is it?
Capycoin is my own cryptocurrency based on blockchain. Implementation is mostly inspired by the [original bitcoin paper by Satoshi Nakamoto.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

It probably should not be used seriously as it is a hobby project.
## Current state
All I have done is research on implementing the blockchain and started programming the p2p network through which the updates on the blockchain should be transferred.
## Contributing
All contributions are welcome, just add a pull request with explanation of the change.
